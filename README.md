This is github first app.Back then i used to think that "App" means like software- android software or some kind of games or some kind of
software.But the definition of app is different when we use it in this field.I know this README.md file is used by google or idk what 
for searching what exactly this repository contains.No i guess it is for the user/visitor who visit my github account and see this repository 
so that they can have idea what exactly this respository is about with reading this README.md file.
